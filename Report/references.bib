    abstract = "In this paper, we introduce the first SemEval shared task on Structured Sentiment Analysis, for which participants are required to predict all sentiment graphs in a text, where a single sentiment graph is composed of a sentiment holder, target, expression and polarity. This new shared task includes two subtracks (monolingual and cross-lingual) with seven datasets available in five languages, namely Norwegian, Catalan, Basque, Spanish and English. Participants submitted their predictions on a held-out test set and were evaluated on Sentiment Graph F1 . Overall, the task received over 200 submissions from 32 participating teams. We present the results of the 15 teams that provided system descriptions and our own expanded analysis of the test predictions.",

    abstract = "This paper presents our solution for SemEval-2022 Task 10: Structured Sentiment Analysis. The solution consisted of two modules: the first for sequence tagging and the second for relation classification. In both modules we used transformer-based language models. In addition to utilizing language models specific to each of the five competition languages, we also adopted multilingual models. This approach allowed us to apply the solution to both monolingual and cross-lingual sub-tasks, where we obtained average Sentiment Graph F1 of 54.5{\%} and 53.1{\%}, respectively. The source code of the prepared solution is available at https://github.com/rafalposwiata/structured-sentiment-analysis.",
